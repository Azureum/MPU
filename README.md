# MPU
## The Matthew Processing unit!
The Matthew Processing Unit! This repository will show my progress of writing my own cpu through verilog and testing it on my FPGA! I have no clue on how this works but through this project I hope to learn how to design and test verilog code and understanding about cpu architecture.

## Tools 

The current FPGA I am using is the Nexys Video Artix-7 FPGA, which has the Xilinx Artix¬Æ-7 XC7A200T and a bunch of other features! You can purchase it here: [here](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/).

I also have a Seven Segement Display PMOD from Digilent, where you can find here: [here](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-ssd-seven-segment-display/).
